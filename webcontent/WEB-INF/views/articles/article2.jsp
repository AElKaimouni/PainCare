<h3>Understanding Endometriosis</h3>

<h3>Endometriosis Symptoms</h3>

<p><strong>Painful sex.</strong> Painful urination and bowel movements. Menstrual cramps that cause stabbing pain
	and aches in the abdomen and lower back. Gastrointestinal disruptions, like painful diarrhea and constipation,
	which patients often confuse for signs of another health issue.</p>

<h3>Endometriosis Development</h3>

<p>The disease occurs when tissue similar to the kind that lines the uterus, known as the <strong>endometrium</strong>,
	grows beyond the uterus and typically implants in the pelvis. When someone with endometriosis has a period, the
	same biochemicals that cause the uterus to contract also activate the endometrium in the pelvis, which can lead
	to intense pain beyond the uterus. But the disorder also causes pain between periods. Endometriosis can block
	fallopian tubes, trapping blood in the ovaries to form fluid-filled cavities known as “<strong>chocolate
		cysts</strong>” (because they contain thick, brown liquid) or endometriomas. In rare cases, those cysts can
	rupture, causing sharp, intense aches. The disorder can also lead to adhesions, bands of scar tissue that cause
	organs to stick together.</p>

<h3>Research on Endometriosis</h3>
<img alt="" src="assets\images\articles\article2-1.jpg">

<p>Emerging research is investigating what causes endometriosis and why some people may be more susceptible than
	others. Studies have shown a link between endometriosis and physical and sexual abuse in childhood or
	adolescence. Scientists are also exploring whether the disease is hereditary: Though the data is inconclusive,
	some doctors consider a family history of endometriosis to be a risk factor.</p>

<h3>Stages of Endometriosis</h3>

<p>While some women experience symptoms during their first periods, others develop endometriosis later in life.
	There are four stages of endometriosis, which the <strong>American Society of Reproductive Medicine</strong>
	classifies as minimal, mild, moderate and severe, based on the location, amount, depth and size of endometrial
	implants in the pelvis.</p>

<h3>Pain Perception and Misdiagnosis</h3>
<img class="art_img" alt="" src="assets\images\articles\article2-2.jpeg">

<p>More extreme pain doesn’t always correlate to a later stage of endometriosis, said <strong>Dr. Monica Woll
		Rosen</strong>, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the <strong>University of Michigan Medical School</strong>.
	Despite patients’ pain, doctors often point to other culprits first before homing in on endometriosis. Most
	women experience a long delay between when they start to experience symptoms and when they actually receive
	treatment, said <strong>Dr. Kathy Huang</strong>, director of the <strong>Endometriosis Center at N.Y.U.
		Langone</strong>.</p>

<h3>Challenges in Diagnosis</h3>

<p>That’s partly because there’s a lack of awareness in the medical community about how the disease manifests and
	partly because doctors are especially poor at identifying painful gastrointestinal symptoms as potential
	endometriosis, she said. Patients themselves often dismiss their own pain, shrugging off endometriosis as just a
	“bad period.”</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>“Every OB-GYN until I was 28 said, ‘That’s normal, some women just have difficult periods,’” said <strong>Lindsey
			Sorensen</strong>, who consistently bled through tampons and pads since she started menstruating at 14.
		Ms. Sorensen, now 38, once had to go to the emergency room when she got her period at work; her boss found her
		curled in the fetal position on the floor of her cubicle. She later found out that she had endometriosis so
		severe that it had reached her rib cage, and bands of tissue had bound together organs in her lower abdomen.
		“One of the big barriers to me is that even for me, as a little girl, I was told that painful periods are
		normal,” Dr. Huang said. “That’s the first myth we need to dispel, that pain is normal.”</p>
