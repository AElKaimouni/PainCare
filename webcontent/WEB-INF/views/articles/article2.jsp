				<p>Endometriosis comes with a tangled knot of symptoms, many of
					which are characterized by extreme pain. Painful sex. Painful
					urination and bowel movements. Menstrual cramps that cause stabbing
					pain and aches in the abdomen and lower back. Gastrointestinal
					disruptions, like painful diarrhea and constipation, which patients
					often confuse for signs of another health issue. The disease occurs
					when tissue similar to the kind that lines the uterus, known as the
					endometrium, grows beyond the uterus and typically implants in the
					pelvis. When someone with endometriosis has a period, the same
					biochemicals that cause the uterus to contract also activate the
					endometrium in the pelvis, which can lead to intense pain beyond
					the uterus. But the disorder also causes pain between periods.
					Endometriosis can block fallopian tubes, trapping blood in the
					ovaries to form fluid-filled cavities known as “chocolate cysts”
					(because they contain thick, brown liquid) or endometriomas. In
					rare cases, those cysts can rupture, causing sharp, intense aches.
					The disorder can also lead to adhesions, bands of scar tissue that
					cause organs to stick together. Emerging research is investigating
					what causes endometriosis and why some people may be more
					susceptible than others. Studies have shown a link between
					endometriosis and physical and sexual abuse in childhood or
					adolescence. Scientists are also exploring whether the disease is
					hereditary: Though the data is inconclusive, some doctors consider
					a family history of endometriosis to be a risk factor. While some
					women experience symptoms during their first periods, others
					develop endometriosis later in life. There are four stages of
					endometriosis, which the American Society of Reproductive Medicine
					classifies as minimal, mild, moderate and severe, based on the
					location, amount, depth and size of endometrial implants in the
					pelvis. More extreme pain doesn’t always correlate to a later stage
					of endometriosis, said Dr. Monica Woll Rosen, an
					obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Michigan Medical
					School. Despite patients’ pain, doctors often point to other
					culprits first before homing in on endometriosis. Most women
					experience a long delay between when they start to experience
					symptoms and when they actually receive treatment, said Dr. Kathy
					Huang, director of the Endometriosis Center at N.Y.U. Langone.

					That’s partly because there’s a lack of awareness in the medical
					community about how the disease manifests and partly because
					doctors are especially poor at identifying painful gastrointestinal
					symptoms as potential endometriosis, she said. Patients themselves
					often dismiss their own pain, shrugging off endometriosis as just a
					“bad period.” “Every OB-GYN until I was 28 said, ‘That’s normal,
					some women just have difficult periods,’” said Lindsey Sorensen,
					who consistently bled through tampons and pads since she started
					menstruating at 14. Ms. Sorensen, now 38, once had to go to the
					emergency room when she got her period at work; her boss found her
					curled in the fetal position on the floor of her cubicle. She later
					found out that she had endometriosis so severe that it had reached
					her rib cage, and bands of tissue had bound together organs in her
					lower abdomen. “One of the big barriers to me is that even for me,
					as a little girl, I was told that painful periods are normal,” Dr.
					Huang said. “That’s the first myth we need to dispel, that pain is
					normal.”
