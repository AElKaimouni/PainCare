				<h3>Surgical Approach</h3>
	<p>All the included guidelines recommend laparoscopic surgery in preference to laparotomy for chronic pain
		of endometriosis and infertility, because of less pain, shorter duration of hospitalization, quicker
		recovery and better cosmetic result [13]. ESHRE guidelines report that laparotomy and laparoscopy are
		equally effective in the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain. None of the above guidelines mentions
		robotic surgery as an option for endometriosis surgery.</p>

	<h3>Meta-analysis</h3>
	<p>A meta-analysis of the available studies showed no other difference in perioperative outcomes between
		robotic and conventional laparoscopic surgery, except the longer time that is needed in robotic surgery
		[14]. ASRM suggests that multiple surgical procedures should be avoided because of adhesions and reduction
		of ovarian reserves. According to ESHRE, CNGOF guidelines, no preoperative hormonal treatment is
		recommended, while the above guidelines and additionally the NICE and SOGC guidelines recommend that
		postoperative hormonal treatment could be considered a secondary prevention. ASRM, ACOG, S2k, and WES
		report conflicting evidence about postoperative treatment in women with endometriosis associated pain or
		endometrioma.</p>

	<h3>Vaginal Procedures</h3>
	<img alt="" src="assets\images\articles\article1-1.png">
	<p>Vaginal procedures for the treatment of deep infiltrating endometriosis are discussed in CNGOF 2007, S2k
		and ESHRE guidelines. CNGOF 2007 underlines that skilled surgeons should carry out laparoscopically
		assisted vaginal procedures and according to the experience of the guideline development group
		exclusively vaginal operations are not recommended, while the latest version of CNGOF guideline does not
		take a position on this issue. The available literature about laparoscopically assisted vaginal procedures
		includes a few retrospective studies with a small number of patients, which conclude that this technique
		could be considered only for the treatment of rectovaginal endometriosis (15).</p>

	<h3>Peritoneal Endometriosis</h3>
	<p>Peritoneal endometriosis recommendations from CNGOF, ESHRE, S2k, ASRM, and SOGC recommend the treatment of
		superficial endometriosis in patients with endometriosis-associated pain. CNGOF, ESHRE, and ASRM do not
		give a preference about the different techniques (ablation, excision), while both S2k and SOGC explicitly
		mention the lack of evidence. WES recommends, in general, excision of any kind of endometriosis lesions.
		The recent evidence is though unclear about the benefit of peritoneal endometriosis excision in women with
		chronic pain [16, 17].</p>

	<h3>Recommendations for Mild Endometriosis and Infertility</h3>
	<p>    
	<ul>
	<li >CNGOF</li>
	<li>NICE</li>
	<li>WES</li>
	<li>ESHRE</li>
	</ul> 
		recommendations agree that women with suspected mild
		endometriosis and infertility should be considered candidates for surgical treatment. A Cochrane
		meta-analysis showed an increased birth rate odds ratio of 1.94, 95% CI 1.20–3.16 for patients with
		infertility who underwent surgery for excision of the endometrial implants [18].</p>

	<h3>Ovarian Endometriosis</h3>
	<p>For surgical treatment, all of the included guidelines follow the recommendation of Hart et al. [19]. In
		this Cochrane review, the authors concluded that laparoscopically cystectomy of endometriomas measuring
		more than 3 cm was superior to drainage and ablation with electrocoagulation in terms of lower recurrence
		of dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, cyst recurrences, and the need for further surgical interventions. Only
		ESHRE and CNGOF discuss laser vaporization in the treatment of endometriomas. After “one-step” laser
		vaporization, a greater recurrence of endometriosis-related ovarian cysts was observed after 12 months of
		follow-up according to Carmona et al. [20]. Nevertheless, recurrence rate did not differ statistically
		significant after 5 years compared to cystectomy. According to ASRM, simple drainage has little
		therapeutic value as the recurrence rate is 80–100% and therefore is no longer being performed. ACOG
		points out that the cyst wall should be removed to obtain a histological sample, especially in women
		without a previous diagnosis of endometriosis, to exclude the small risk of malignancy [21]. CNGOF and
		ASRM underline that surgical treatment of endometriomas by cystectomy or ablation can reduce ovarian
		reserve, with a negative implication on fertility. 
		<img class="art_img" alt="" src="assets\images\articles\article1-2 (2).jpg">
		The risk increases for women with large, recurrent, or
		bilateral endometriomas. Measurement of AMH prior to ovarian surgery has to be considered. In infertile
		patients, surgery of endometriomas does not improve the outcome of IVF according to the same guideline.
		ESHRE recommends that cystectomy possibly should be performed, rather than ablation or other therapeutic
		managements in infertile patients, while according to S2k, the effect of ovarian endometriomas on the
		outcome of IVF is unclear. WES reminds that oocyte freezing should be discussed in young women prior to
		the surgery of endometrioma [22]. Conclusively independent of the surgical method of intervention, the
		concept of minimizing the negative effects on the ovarian reserve should consist of a priority [23].</p>
