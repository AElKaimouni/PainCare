				<p>Surgical approach All the included guidelines recommend
					laparoscopic surgery in preference to laparotomy for chronic pain
					of endometriosis and infertility, because of less pain, shorter
					duration of hospitalisation, quicker recovery and better cosmetic
					result [13]. ESHRE guidelines reports that laparotomy and
					laparoscopy are equally effective in the treatment of
					endometriosis-associated pain. None of the above guidelines
					mentions robotic surgery as an option for endometriosis surgery. A
					meta-analysis of the available studies showed no other difference
					in perioperative outcomes between robotic and conventional
					laparoscopic surgery, except the longer time that is needed in
					robotic surgery [14]. ASRM suggests that multiple surgical
					procedures should be avoided because of adhesions and reduction of
					ovarian reserves. According to ESHRE, CNGOF guidelines no
					preoperative hormonal treatment is recommended, while the above
					guidelines and additional the NICE and SOGC guidelines recommend
					that postoperative hormonal treatment could be considered a
					secondary prevention. ASRM, ACOG, S2k and WES report conflicting
					evidence about postoperative treatment in women with endometriosis
					associated pain or endometrioma. Vaginal procedures for treatment
					of deep infiltrating endometriosis are discussed in CNGOF 2007, S2k
					and ESHRE guidelines. CNGOF 2007 underlines that skilled surgeons
					should carry out laparoscopically assisted vaginal procedures and
					according to experience of the guideline development group
					exclusively vaginal operations are not recommended, while the
					latest version of CNGOF guideline does not take position on this
					issue. The available literature about laparoscopically assisted
					vaginal procedures includes a few retrospective studies with small
					number of patients, which conclude that this technic could be
					considered only for the treatment of rectovaginal endometriosis
					(15). Peritoneal endometriosis CNGOF, ESHRE, S2k, ASRM and SOGC
					recommend the treatment of superficial endometriosis in patients
					with endometriosis associated pain. CNGOF, ESHRE and ASRM do not
					give a preference about the different techniques (ablation,
					excision), while both S2k and SOGC explicitly mention the lack of
					evidence. WES recommends in general excision of any kind of
					endometriosis lesions. The recent evidence is though unclear about
					the benefit of peritoneal endometriosis excision in women with
					chronic pain [16, 17]. CNGOF, NICE, WES, ESHREM S2k ACOG and ASRM
					recommendations agree that women with suspected mild endometriosis
					and infertility should be considered candidates for surgical
					treatment. A Cochrane meta-analyses showed an increased birth rate
					odds ratio of 1.94, 95% CI 1.20–3.16 for patients with infertility
					who underwent surgery for excision of the endometrial implants
					[18]. Ovarian endometriosis For surgical treatment all of the
					included guidelines follow the recommendation of Hart et al. [19].
					In this Cochrane review the authors concluded that laparoscopically
					cystectomy of endometriomas measuring more than 3 cm was superior
					to drainage and ablation with electrocoagulation in terms of lower
					recurrence of dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, cyst recurrences and the
					need for further surgical interventions. Only ESHRE and CNGOF
					discuss laser vaporization in treatment of endometriomas. After
					“one-step” laser vaporization, a greater recurrence of
					endometriosis related ovarian cysts was observed after 12 months of
					follow up according to Carmona et al. [20]. Nevertheless,
					recurrence rate did not differ statistically significant after 5
					years compared to cystectomy. According to ASRM, simple drainage
					has a little therapeutic value as recurrence rate is 80–100% and
					therefore is no longer being performed. ACOG points out, that, cyst
					wall should be removed to obtain a histological sample, especially
					in women without a previous diagnosis of endometriosis, in order to
					exclude the small risk of malignancy [21]. CNGOF and ASRM underline
					that surgical treatment of endometriomas by cystectomy or ablation
					can reduce ovarian reserve, with negative implication on fertility.
					The risk increases for woman with large, recurrent or bilateral
					endometriomas. Measurement of AMH prior to ovarian surgery has to
					be considered. In infertile patients surgery of endometriomas does
					not improve the outcome of IVF according to the same guideline.
					ESHRE recommends that cystectomy possible should be performed,
					rather than ablation or other therapeutic managements in infertile
					patients, while according to S2k, the effect of ovarian
					endometriomas on the outcome of IVF is unclear. WES reminds that
					oocyte freezing should be discussed in young women prior to surgery
					of endometrioma [22]. Conclusively independent of the surgical
					method of intervention, the concept of minimizing the negative
					effects on the ovarian reserve should consist a priority [23].</p>
