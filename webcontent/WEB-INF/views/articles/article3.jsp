				<p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Most labs devoted to women’s diseases are
					accompanied by obvious symbols of womanhood: a rose, a tulip, an
					hourglass silhouette. Not Linda Griffith’s. Tucked away in the
					building for biological engineering, the M.I.T. Center for
					Gynepathology Research is marked only by the letters CGR in red and
					black, the G formed from a curved arrow representing the hand of
					the engineer. “We needed something that wasn’t all pink and
					flowers,” said Dr. Griffith, the lab’s director. “We really thought
					it should be, like, ‘This is science.’” Dr. Griffith founded the
					lab in 2009 with the goal of helping researchers solve
					endometriosis, a chronic disorder in which tissue similar to that
					which normally lines the uterus instead grows outside it. The
					disease strikes one in 10 women, as well as trans men and nonbinary
					people who menstruate. Its hallmarks are extreme pain and, in some
					cases, infertility. Yet it suffers from a branding problem: It
					falls into the abyss of “women’s diseases” (overlooked), diseases
					that don’t kill you (unimportant) and menstrual problems (taboo).
					Researchers often call endometriosis “benign,” as in noncancerous —
					but doing so, Dr. Griffith believes, lessens the seriousness of a
					common, painful disease. Her mission is to change the conversation,
					from one of women’s pain to one of biomarkers, genetics and
					molecular networks. “I don’t want to make endometriosis a women’s
					issue,” she told the M.I.T. Tech Review in 2014. “I want to make it
					an M.I.T. issue.” Dr. Griffith, 60, with a fringe of blonde hair
					and a slight Georgia drawl, is uniquely poised to help effect that
					transition. She started her career in bioengineering, sculpting
					organs like liver and bone from scratch by seeding polymer
					scaffolds with living cells. In 1997, she helped create an iconic
					creature called the “earmouse” by injecting a human ear-shaped
					scaffold with cartilage from a cow’s knee, and growing it on the
					back of a lab mouse. Now she brings those skills to the task of
					better understanding the uterus. In her lab, she has begun growing
					uterine organoids — tiny domed droplets, with glands that look like
					swirling craters — from the uterine cells of endometriosis
					patients. These “patient avatars” are ideal tools for testing
					potential new treatments for the disease: Biologically, they are
					closer to human uterine cells than those of mice (which don’t
					naturally menstruate). And they enable researchers to sidestep the
					ethical issues that would arise with human trials. “That’s really
					the power of this,” Dr. Griffith said. “You can take patients who
					we know how they respond or do not respond to therapies, and
					compare and start to understand and tease apart why that is.” Her
					research highlights what a remarkable organ the uterus truly is —
					and not just during its signature function, pregnancy. Humans,
					unlike almost every other mammal, grow their entire endometrium —
					the womb’s inner lining — once a month, whether or not a fertilized
					egg takes hold. If no egg appears, they shed it.</p>
