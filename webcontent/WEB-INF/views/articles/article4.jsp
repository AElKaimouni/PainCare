				<p>Women will be given a potential new treatment for
					endometriosis in a groundbreaking clinical trial that doctors hope
					will pave the way for the first new class of drug for the condition
					in 40 years. The trial will involve 100 women in Edinburgh and
					London and will assess whether the drug, dichloroacetate, helps
					relieve pain. If successful, it would be the first non-hormonal,
					non-surgical treatment for endometriosis, which affects roughly one
					in 10 women of reproductive age. “We know women with endometriosis
					desperately want more treatment options and better ways to manage
					the often-debilitating pain that it causes,” said Dr Lucy Whitaker,
					a clinical lecturer in obstetrics and gynaecology at the University
					of Edinburgh, who is leading the research. “Our research so far
					shows promising results that dichloroacetate can make a huge
					difference. I hope our new trial will confirm this and give women
					hope that new treatments and a better quality of life are on the
					horizon.” Endometriosis affects 1.5 million women in the UK and
					occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows
					elsewhere in the body. During a woman’s period, these cells bleed,
					causing inflammation, pain and the formation of scar tissue. A lack
					of awareness of the condition, compounded by the requirement for a
					diagnostic laparoscopy, means that women in the UK typically wait
					eight years for a diagnosis after first experiencing symptoms.

					Current treatment options include conventional pain relief,
					hormonal contraceptives and surgery. However, hormone-based
					treatments – typically the pill or a contraceptive implant – have
					side-effects and are not suitable for everyone, including those
					trying to conceive. Surgery carries risks and is not always
					effective in the long term, with studies showing that about half of
					those who have surgery experience a return of symptoms within five
					years. Janet Lindsay, the chief executive of Wellbeing of Women, a
					women’s health charity that is funding the trial with the Scottish
					government, said that progress in treating endometriosis was “long
					overdue”. “It is completely unacceptable that there have been no
					new treatments for endometriosis in 40 years,” she said. “Too many
					women and girls are suffering from debilitating symptoms, such as
					chronic pelvic pain, fatigue and even fertility problems, and
					current hormonal and surgical treatments aren’t suitable for
					everyone.” The latest trial builds on previous research showing
					that cells from the pelvic wall of women with endometriosis produce
					higher amounts of lactate, a potentially harmful waste product that
					is normally produced by muscles and red blood cells when the body
					is running low on oxygen during exercise. In endometriosis,
					lab-based experiments suggested the lactate was creating an
					environment that fuelled the development and growth of endometrial
					tissue. When cells were treated with dichloroacetate, in the lab
					and in mouse experiments, lactate production decreased to normal
					levels and the size of the endometriosis lesions was reduced. The
					drug is already licensed as a medicine to treat rare childhood
					metabolic disorders and various cancers, meaning that it has an
					established safety profile. In a pilot study, with 30 women, the
					main side-effects were a slightly upset stomach on starting the
					medication and a tingling sensation in the fingers. In the latest
					trial, which will start recruiting this autumn, half of the women
					will receive dichloroacetate and half will be given a placebo and
					they will take the tablets for 12 weeks. The participants will
					complete a series of questionnaires and give blood samples over the
					course of two-and-a-half years, to determine whether the treatment
					is effective for relieving pain and other symptoms. Dr Ranee
					Thakar, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and
					Gynaecologists, welcomed the trial. “We know current endometriosis
					treatment options don’t work well for everyone, leaving many women
					with symptoms that can have a serious impact on their quality of
					life, affecting their physical and mental health,” she said. “We
					look forward to the results of this trial and it’s potential to
					improve the day-to-day lives of women and people living with
					endometriosis.”</p>
