			<h3>Groundbreaking Clinical Trial for Endometriosis Treatment</h3>

<p>Women will be given a potential new treatment for endometriosis in a groundbreaking clinical trial that doctors hope
	will pave the way for the first new class of 
		<img class="art_img" alt="" src="assets\images\articles\article4-1.jpg">
	drug for the condition in 40 years. The trial will involve 100 women
	in Edinburgh and London and will assess whether the drug, dichloroacetate, helps relieve pain. If successful, it
	would be the first non-hormonal, non-surgical treatment for endometriosis, which affects roughly one in 10 women
	of reproductive age.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Location: Edinburgh and London</li>
	<li>Participants: 100 women</li>
	<li>Focus: Assessing the potential of dichloroacetate as a new treatment</li>
</ul>

<p>“We know women with endometriosis desperately want more treatment options and better ways to manage the
	often-debilitating pain that it causes,” said Dr Lucy Whitaker, a clinical lecturer in obstetrics and gynaecology
	at the University of Edinburgh, who is leading the research. “Our research so far shows promising results that
	dichloroacetate can make a huge difference. I hope our new trial will confirm this and give women hope that new
	treatments and a better quality of life are on the horizon.”</p>

<h3>Endometriosis: A Common Yet Overlooked Condition</h3>
		<img class="art_img" alt="" src="assets\images\articles\article4-2.jpg">

<p>Endometriosis affects 1.5 million women in the UK and occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows
	elsewhere in the body. During a woman’s period, these cells bleed, causing inflammation, pain, and the formation
	of scar tissue. A lack of awareness of the condition, compounded by the requirement for a diagnostic laparoscopy,
	means that women in the UK typically wait eight years for a diagnosis after first experiencing symptoms.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Prevalence: Affects 1.5 million women in the UK</li>
	<li>Cause: Tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows outside the body</li>
	<li>Symptoms: Inflammation, pain, and the formation of scar tissue during a woman’s period</li>
</ul>

<h3>Current Treatment Challenges</h3>

<p>Current treatment options include conventional pain relief, hormonal contraceptives, and surgery. However,
	hormone-based treatments – typically the pill or a contraceptive implant – have side-effects and are not suitable
	for everyone, including those trying to conceive. Surgery carries risks and is not always effective in the long
	term,</p>

<ul>

	<li>Challenges: Hormone-based treatments have side-effects, and surgery is not always effective in the long term</li>
	<li>Wait Time: Typically eight years for a diagnosis after symptoms begin</li>
</ul>

<p>Janet Lindsay, the chief executive of Wellbeing of Women, a women’s health charity that is funding the trial with
	the Scottish government, said that progress in treating endometriosis was “long overdue”. “It is completely
	unacceptable that there have been no new treatments for endometriosis in 40 years,” she said. “Too many women and
	girls are suffering from debilitating symptoms, such as chronic pelvic pain, fatigue and even fertility problems,
	and current hormonal and surgical treatments aren’t suitable for everyone.” The latest trial builds on previous
	research showing that cells from the pelvic wall of women with endometriosis produce higher amounts of lactate, a
	potentially harmful waste product that is normally produced by muscles and red blood cells when the body is
	running low on oxygen during exercise. In endometriosis, lab-based experiments suggested the lactate was creating
	an environment that fuelled the development and growth of endometrial tissue.</p>
